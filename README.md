Data Analytics Portfolio

This portfolio is a collection of python code and exercises for reference. The focus of the code is based around Data Science. It includes code for algorithms, exercises I have completed, and some notes regarding the metrics for certain algorithms. It serves as a 'portable' toolset that can be quickly accessed whenever it is needed.
